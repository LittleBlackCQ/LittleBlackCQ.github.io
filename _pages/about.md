I am a senior undergraduate student from [UM-SJTU JI](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/), majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I am going to graduate in Aug. of 2024. 

My research interests are embedding advanced AI tools in real-world difficulties. Specifically, I am exploring the methods to extract aligned features from multi-modalities of different stages during the Electrionic Design Automation (EDA). The final goal is to equip the Large Circuit Model with the ability to understand the essence of computation.

Previously, I worked with Prof. [Ming Yang](https://cyberc3.sjtu.edu.cn/) and Prof. [Yeqiang Qian](https://automation.sjtu.edu.cn/QIAN-Yeqiang) in the Department of Automation of SJTU on the 3D vision by LiDARs. I also worked with Prof. [Yutong Ban](https://people.csail.mit.edu/yban/) of UM-SJTU JI on motion planning of robots using diffusion models.
