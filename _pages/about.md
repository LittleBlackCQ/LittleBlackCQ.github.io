Hi, I'm Kezhi Li (李柯志). I am a first-year Ph.D. candidate in the [CURE Lab](https://cure-lab.github.io/) at The Chinese University of Hong Kong supervised by [Prof. Qiang Xu](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/people/faculty/qiang-xu/). Previously, I worked with Prof. [Ming Yang](https://cyberc3.sjtu.edu.cn/) and Prof. [Yeqiang Qian](https://automation.sjtu.edu.cn/QIAN-Yeqiang) in the Department of Automation of Shanghai Jiao Tong University on the 3D vision by LiDARs during my undergraduate. I obtained my B.Eng in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [UM-SJTU JI](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/).

My research interests are embedding advanced AI tools in industrial applications rather than CV or NLP. Specifically, I am exploring the methods to extract aligned features from multi-modalities of different stages during the Electronic Design Automation (EDA). The final goal is to equip the Large Circuit Model with the ability to understand the essence of computation. If you are interested, feel free to contact me via my email.
