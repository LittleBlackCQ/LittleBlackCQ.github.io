I am a senior undergraduate student from University of Michigan, Shanghai Jiaotong University Joint Institute (UM-SJTU JI). My major is Electrical and Computer Engineering. I am going to obtain my B.E. degree in the summer of 2024. 

My research interests are using advanced AI tools to solve complex real world questions. Specifically, I am exploring the methods to extract aligned features from multi-modalities of different stages during the Electrionic Design Automation (EDA). The final goal is to make a Large Circuit Model encompassing the ability to understand the procedure of computation.

Previously, I worked with Prof. Ming Yang and Prof. Yeqiang Qian in the Department of Automation of SJTU on the 3D vision by LiDARs. I also worked on a project with Prof. Yutong Ban of UM-SJTU JI on motion planning of robots using diffusion models.
